So, heres the first 30 day challenge. This month, I chose three goals, all of which are "do X for Y minutes every day" goals. The goals for this month are **Bodyweight Exercise**, **Apartment Cleaning**, and **Rust Programming**.

## Twenty Minutes of Body Weight Exercise every day

<hr>

### What started this?

For the last few years, I've been oscillating between my goal weight and way higher than my goal weight. The cycle generally goes:

* Feel terrible about my current weight
* Change what I eat, usually doing a keto diet for 3-6 months
* Reach my goal weight
* Return to drinking beer, eating pizza, regaining weight

I've done a good job of keeping to my diet and reaching my weight goals, however I have never reliably paired any fitness with my diet. Because of this, once I add any unhealthy food back into my diet, most of my progress is lost. I would like to change this, or at least slow the cycle.

### Whats the plan?

My plan is to spend 20 minutes doing some sort of exercise every day, none of which that requires expensive equipment, memberships, or travel. Without doing research, I plan to do at least the following things:

* Burpees
* Bodyweight squats
* Planks
* Push-ups
* Yoga

### What does success mean?

Success for this goal means logging what I did, when I did it, and how much did I do. There might even be progress photos.

## Twenty minutes of Apartment Cleaning every day

<hr>

### What started this?

I never have been good at organization, cleaning, or decorating. Whether it is dishes, laundry, or whatever else around the house, I tend to do the minimum necessary to not feel gross in my own home. Most days, I wouldn't be happy to host anyone at my place without a few hours of cleaning first. Typically I do the minimum amount of cleaning, and on a few days a month I put in hours of work getting my place presentable.

I would much rather try to do this continously, so there is never a need to spend a full hour on dishes, taking out the recycling, or any other single chore.

One of my other goals in the backlog is to Pinterest my apartment, and having a clean apartment seems like a prerequisite for that.

### Whats the plan?

This one seems straightforward to me, at first. Spend some time cleaning. I'm sure as I go, I will find better and more intelligent ways to approach the problem.

### What does success mean?

Success for this goal means logging how much I spent cleaning, and what I spent it on. Additionally I plan to answer the following questions every day:

* Am I happy with how my apartment looks?
* Would I let a guest come over now?
* Would I let a guest come over if I had 15 minutes to clean first?

## Work on a program in Rust every day

<hr>

### What started this?

I've been interested in Rust as a language for a little over a year, and working in the language mostly through the [coap-rs](https://github.com/Covertness/coap-rs) project. This past week, I gave an hour long introduction into the language at my work.

I would like to get to a level of proficiency where I can use Rust as a primary language rather than just a hobby. Part of this means being familiar enough with the language to program, debug, as well as teach others.

### Whats the plan?

My plan is to spend at least an hour a day working in Rust or learning about Rust. I will work on open source projects, including some personal ones.

### What does success mean?

Success for this goal means a git contribution log for every day this month in a Rust project.
